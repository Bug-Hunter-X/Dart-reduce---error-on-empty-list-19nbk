# Dart reduce() Error on Empty List

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when using the `reduce()` method on an empty list.  The `reduce()` method requires at least one element to perform the reduction; attempting to use it on an empty list will result in a runtime exception.

The `bug.dart` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version that handles the empty list case gracefully.
